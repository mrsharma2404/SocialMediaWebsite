# SocialMediaWebsite
This Website is developed in React,Node and MySQL

as we have default main barach so you are only seeing the readme file.
click on main and select master as your branch here so you will see the folder named(facebook).

in facebook we have 4 different folders api frontend and socket.

in api folder you will see the all backent apis basically this folder was created in node.

in frontend folder you will see all the js files in my component this folder was made in react.

in socket folder you see only 3-4 files in which index that is your main code for socket.

in dump folder you see all data datbase table.
just make aschema in your mysql named(facebook) and import all these tables. 

i did not use bycrypt and json web token here because if i add them then the code will become more messy.
for bycrypt and json webtokens with refresh tokens you can see my another repository named bycrypt and JWT.
if you know MERN a lil bit you can easily appply those web tokens and bycrypt.
